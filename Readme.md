## Project Structure

```
├── App.tsx           # Main entry file
├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
├── package.json      # Dependencies & scripts
├── assets/           # Images, fonts, and other assets
└── components/       # Reusable UI components
```

---

## Usage

* Modify `App.tsx` or add new components in `components/`
* Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
* Run on iOS, Android, or web using Expo Go

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter:

```
ConfigError: Cannot determine the project's Expo SDK version because the module expo is not installed.
```

Make sure you run:

```bash
npm install expo
```

and restart the server.

If you want, I can also **add a “Starter UI Screenshots & Demo” section** so it looks more professional for GitHub. Do you want me to add that?
